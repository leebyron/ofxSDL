ofxSDL (v0.01)

An openFrameworks addOn which overrides the windowing system to use SDL rather than GLUT.
There are a handful of benefits from using SDL including:

 * Rich events from Joysticks and Controllers
 * Events from Mouse scroll wheel
 * Unicode Keyboard support (TODO)

This ofxSDL addOn was designed to be used with the v006 branch of openFrameworks

===============================================================================

ofxSDL is in its infancy, and is missing some major chunks of functionality.
It's not that they are necessarily difficult to implement, but that I have limited
time and resources to contribute. Feel free to send me patches on git-hub.

TODO:
* Decouple from OSX framework, support for Win + Linux
* Unicode Keyboard support
* Set window title, size, and position
* Poco events
* Toggle and set fullscreen
* (anything else?)
